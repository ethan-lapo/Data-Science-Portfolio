# Data Science Portfolio

This is my portfolio that houses all the data science projects I have done in my free time. This is for self-learning and expanding my knowledge in this field.

# Projects

### Customer Churn Prediction

[Customer Churn](https://github.com/ethan-lapo/Customer-Churn.git)

I was tasked with predicting whether or not a customer would churn for the final project in one of my masters classes. I used a real-world dataset and logistic regression for the model.


### House Sales Price Prediction

[House Prediction Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/ethan-lapo/House-Prediction-Kaggle-Competition.git)

In this Kaggle competition, I was tasked with predicting the price of what a house sells for. I cleaned the data and used a Gradient Boosted Regression model to predict the sales price given a number of features. 



### Stroke Prediction

[Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/ethan-lapo/Stroke-Prediction.git)

I was given the stroke prediction dataset from Kaggle and wanted to develop a model that would predict if a patient is likely to have a stroke. The model I came up with was a logistic regression model that limits the amount of false negatives. 


### Used Car Price Prediction

[Car Prediction](https://github.com/ethan-lapo/Car-Prediction.git)

Using the used car dataset from Kaggle I wanted to predict the price of a used car given certain features. I went with a gradient boosted regression model for machine learning project.
