# Projects

### House Sales Price Prediction

[House Prediction Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/ethan-lapo/House-Prediction-Kaggle-Competition.git)

In this Kaggle competition, I was tasked with predicting the price of what a house sells for. I cleaned the data and used a Gradient Boosted Regression model to predict the sales price given a number of features. 



### Stroke Prediction


I was given the stroke prediction dataset from Kaggle and wanted to develop a model that would predict if a patient is likely to have a stroke. The model I came up with was a logistic regression model that limits the amount of false negatives.
